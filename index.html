  <h1>First Paragraph</h1>
<p>Puppies are the most playful and miniature pure form of love and cherishable memories.They can get messy at times,but we all know how adorable they are when they're playing.</p>
<p>Training them would result in good behaviour and the urge to obey our command at all times.When they do good,it is nice to treat them.</p>

<h1>Second Paragraph</h1>
<p>Puppies can be the most minipulative creatures because they can change a person's moods,feelings and the way that person thinks.</p>
<p>Many people who don't ever want a pet often get taken aback by the cuteness a puppy has and they often want that puppy imediately.</p>
<p>No one wants to be lonely and wonder if life can be any more harder than what they are going through.A person can cuddle with a puppy and they suddenly feel good about what makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Puppies would play fight with each other and are learning to be tough.</p>

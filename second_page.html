<h1>First Paragraph</h1>
<p>My name is Katelynn Wymane.I have an exceptional love for dogs,but mostly I love puppies.Alot.</p>
<p>I have a female dog and her name is Poppy and I also have two puppies remaining from her.They are a boy and a girl and their names are Duke and Star.</p>
<p>I live in Wentworth,Durban with my family.I attend Fairvale Secondary and am only turning 16.</p>

<h1>Second Paragraph</h1>
<p>Having dogs is alot of work,even for me.I sometimes get to play with my puppies,not my dog,whenever I get time to relax.I love it when we play because I feel so happy to be playing with them.</p>
<p>Sometimes I play outside too long and I have to go back inside because it sometimes gets a little cold out.I feed them and share all my love with them.I just can't get enough of them puppies.</p>
<p>I really love my puppies and dog as much as I love my family.</p>
